### My Thoughts on the Learning Objectives for All Three Notebooks

The three notebooks collectively form a progressive exploration of neural network-based text classification, building from simpler embedding-based models to more advanced architectures. The overarching learning objective appears to be **developing an intuition for how different neural architectures handle text data, manage embeddings, mitigate overfitting, and perform on sentiment classification tasks**. This is achieved through experimentation with hyperparameters, training strategies, and model comparisons, while emphasizing practical skills like using Keras/TensorFlow, Hugging Face Transformers, and analyzing training dynamics (e.g., loss, accuracy, and overfitting).

- **DAN Notebook (Deep Averaging Networks)**: Focuses on foundational concepts like Word2Vec embeddings, the impact of shuffling training data, and embedding training strategies (static vs. fine-tuned, pre-trained vs. random). The objective here is to understand how simple averaging-based networks behave with embeddings and how data preparation (e.g., shuffling) affects generalization.
  
- **CNN Notebook (Convolutional Neural Networks)**: Builds on embeddings but introduces convolutional layers for capturing local patterns in text. The key objective is learning to diagnose and fix overfitting by tuning hyperparameters (e.g., filters, kernel sizes, dropout, batch size), highlighting the trade-offs between model complexity and regularization.

- **BERT Notebook (Transformer-based Models)**: Shifts to pre-trained transformers, covering tokenization, fine-tuning, layer freezing, and overfitting in large models. The objective is to grasp transfer learning, contextual embeddings, and strategies for adapting massive pre-trained models to downstream tasks without excessive overfitting.

Overall, the notebooks teach:
- **Embedding Strategies**: Pre-trained vs. random, trainable vs. frozen.
- **Overfitting Management**: Through shuffling, hyperparameter tuning, and layer freezing.
- **Model Comparison**: From lightweight (DAN, CNN) to heavyweight (BERT), showing how complexity impacts performance and runtime.
- **Practical NLP Skills**: Data preparation, model building, evaluation, and interpretation of results (e.g., loss ratios, cosine similarities).
- **Broader Insights**: Encourages critical thinking about why models overfit, how context affects embeddings (e.g., polysemy like "bank"), and the benefits of transfer learning.

These objectives align with intermediate NLP/ML courses, emphasizing experimentation over theory. Total points (95) suggest a graded assignment focusing on implementation accuracy and analysis.

### Summary on Observations and Learning Objectives

#### Key Observations from the Experiments
Based on the notebooks and answers, here are the main observations, grouped by notebook:

- **DAN Notebook**:
  - **Data Balance**: Training set is nearly balanced (49.845% positive), while test is slightly more (50.26%), suggesting no major class imbalance issues.
  - **Shuffling Impact**: Without shuffling, the model overfits severely (val_acc=1.0 after 10 epochs), but shuffling improves generalization (val_acc=0.63574). Observation: Shuffling prevents the model from memorizing ordered patterns, reducing overfitting.
  - **Embedding Strategies**: Static Word2Vec embeddings yield val_acc=0.75700. Fine-tuning Word2Vec embeddings improves to 0.79299, while random initialization + training gives 0.78200. Observation: Pre-trained embeddings provide a better starting point, but fine-tuning helps adapt to the task; random init performs close but may require more epochs.
  - **Overall**: DANs are simple and fast but sensitive to data order and embedding quality.

- **CNN Notebook**:
  - **Overfitting Dynamics**: Val_loss decreases initially (0.46626 → 0.40067 over 5 epochs) but plateaus, indicating overfitting. Tuning hyperparameters (e.g., fewer filters [64,64,32], kernel sizes [3,4,5], dense dims [64], dropout=0.6, frozen embeddings, batch_size=64) stabilizes it.
  - **Observation**: CNNs capture n-gram patterns well but overfit easily with high complexity; regularization (dropout, smaller layers) and frozen embeddings prevent this. Runtime likely increases with larger batches/models, but plots (not shown in docs) would reveal diverging train/val curves pre-tuning.
  - **Comparison to DAN**: CNN likely outperforms DAN on local features but requires more tuning.

- **BERT Notebook**:
  - **Tokenization**: Attention masks pad sequences (e.g., 4 vs. 1 zeros). BERT outputs 2 tensors; token-level embeddings are from the first. 'Bank' has input_id=3085 but different indices (2 vs. 4) due to context. Cosine similarity for 'bank' (0.74783) is lower than for 'this'/'the' (0.81103), showing contextual disambiguation.
  - **Classification**: Twitter RoBERTa (checkpoint: "cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest", trained on ~124M tweets, paper: "TimeLMs: Diachronic Language Models from Twitter") achieves val_acc=0.896 after 2 epochs, better than BERT-base.
  - **Freezing Layers**: Lowest unfrozen layers: val_acc=0.80800. Better version: train_loss=0.28260, val_loss=0.32886 (ratio=0.85934>0.7), val_acc=0.85900. Overfitting version: train_loss=0.14960, val_loss=0.38383 (ratio=0.38976<0.5), val_acc=0.86460.
  - **Observation**: BERT/RoBERTa excel via transfer learning but overfit if too many layers are trainable; freezing lower layers preserves pre-trained knowledge. RoBERTa outperforms BERT due to domain-specific (Twitter) pre-training. GPU is crucial for runtime (~1 hour total).

- **Cross-Notebook Observations**:
  - **Performance Trends**: BERT/RoBERTa (0.896 val_acc) > CNN (tuned to ~0.85-0.90 implied) > DAN (0.79 max). Transformers handle context better but are computationally heavier.
  - **Overfitting Commonality**: All models overfit without intervention (e.g., shuffling, dropout, freezing). Loss ratios highlight this: high ratio (>0.7) = good fit; low (<0.5) = overfit.
  - **Embeddings Evolution**: From static Word2Vec (DAN) to trainable (CNN) to contextual (BERT), showing progression in sophistication.
  - **Runtime and Resources**: DAN/CNN are lighter; BERT requires GPU and careful layer management to avoid long training.

#### Tie-Back to Learning Objectives
These observations reinforce the objectives: Learners experiment with embeddings (e.g., fine-tuning improves DAN/CNN but risks overfitting in BERT), overfitting fixes (shuffling, dropout, freezing), and architecture trade-offs (simple DAN for basics vs. BERT for SOTA). The assignment builds intuition for real-world NLP: Start simple, tune for overfitting, leverage pre-training for complex tasks. It also teaches debugging (e.g., cosine similarity for context) and research (e.g., model cards/papers). Overall, it prepares for deploying scalable text classifiers while understanding limitations like data order sensitivity or computational demands.
